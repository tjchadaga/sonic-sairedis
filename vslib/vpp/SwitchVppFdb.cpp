/* ======================================================================
 * L2 classify-based punt infrastructure.
 *
 * Shared classify tables and resolved hit-next indices are initialised
 * lazily on the first BD member add and persist for the lifetime of
 * the process.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - LLDP (0x88cc): redirect to linux-cp-punt at l2-input-classify
 *     so the frame ends up on the originating member's LCP host tap.
 *   - DHCPv4 client→server broadcast: redirect to
 *     sonic-ext-l2-trap-fixup, which sets VLIB_RX to the parent
 *     physical interface (parent of the bridged sub-if), and hands
 *     forwards to linux-cp-punt -> bvi-host-tap interface-output ->
 *     sonic-ext-aggr-tap-redirect -> member-host-tap.  This emulates
 *     SAI_PACKET_ACTION_TRAP for DHCP on VPP-VS: the L2-flood is
 *     skipped entirely, so no copies are flooded to other VLAN
 *     members (sonic-mgmt DHCPBroadcastNotFloodedTest depends on
 *     this).
 *
 * LLDP needs the classifier to work around a VPP behavior: link-local
 * multicast frames (DA in 01:80:c2:00:00:00..0F) are flooded by the BD
 * because l2-input strips L2INPUT_FEAT_FWD from the per-buffer feature
 * bitmap for any frame with the multicast bit set, so the FDB is never
 * consulted and a static l2fib entry cannot suppress the flood.  Without
 * the classifier the LLDP frame would be flooded to every BD member
 * (including the BVI flood-copy, which then punts via linux-cp-punt-xc
 * to the BVI host tap), causing lldpd to observe the same neighbour on
 * multiple netdevs and producing inconsistent neighbour discovery
 * results.  The l2-input-classify arc runs before the multicast
 * feat-mask strip, so a redirect-punt session here consumes the frame
 * and delivers it only to the originating member's LCP host tap.
 *
 * DHCP needs the classifier for the dual problem: a client broadcast
 * (dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) would otherwise hit the BD's l2-flood and
 * fan out to every member port.  Trapping at l2-input-classify
 * consumes the buffer before flood, then this node hand-off to
 * sonic-ext-l2-trap-fixup delivers exactly one copy via the parent
 * phys's host tap (where the kernel's 8021q layer demuxes it up to
 * the Vlan netdev where dhcrelay is listening).
 *
 * LACP (0x8809) is intentionally NOT in the classifier: linux-cp
 * registers linux-cp-punt-xc as the ethernet-input next for 0x8809
 * (and 0x88cc, 0x0806) via lcp_ethertype_enable() at startup.  For
 * LACP that dispatch happens in ethernet-input on the parent phy --
 * before l2-input runs and before any sub-interface dispatch -- so
 * LACP never reaches the BD and never needs to be classifier-punted.
 * The same is true for tagged LLDP: ethernet-input dispatches by
 * outer ethertype, and 0x88cc != 0x8100, so tagged LLDP also bypasses
 * the BD via the same linux-cp-punt-xc shortcut.  Only untagged LLDP
 * (which arrives on a parent that IS in the BD) needs the classifier.
 *
 * ARP and IPv6 ND are normally handled by the sonic_ext VPP plugin via
 * the arp arc -> sonic-ext-aggr-tap-redirect on the BVI tap.  See
 * platform/vpp/vppbld/plugins/sonic_ext/.  That path depends on the
 * BD flood copy reaching the BVI, so the BD flood bit is never cleared,
 * not even when orchagent asks for FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE_NONE: VPP shares
 * one L2INPUT_FEAT_FLOOD bit between broadcast and multicast, so it
 * cannot express either SAI attribute without also applying the other.
 * Instead the members of such a VLAN are switched over to the punting
 * table variants below.  A classify hit is terminal, so each punt
 * suppresses the flood for exactly its own traffic class:
 *
 *   SAI_VLAN_ATTR_BROADCAST_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE        == NONE
 *       -> *_arp_table   (dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype 0x0806)
 *   SAI_VLAN_ATTR_UNKNOWN_MULTICAST_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE == NONE
 *       -> *_ip6mc_table (dst 33:33:*)
 *
 * The two are independent knobs.  See
 * SwitchVpp::vpp_set_vlan_attribute().
 *
 * Slot selection in l2-input-classify (vnet/l2/l2_input_classify.c):
 * VPP picks the per-interface table by *outer* ethertype at
 * current_data (h0->type):
 *   - 0x0800 (IPv4)   -> ip4_table_index
 *   - 0x86DD (IPv6)   -> ip6_table_index
 *   - everything else -> other_table_index   (incl. 0x8100 VLAN, 0x88CC LLDP)
 *
 * Consequently:
 *
 *   Untagged member  (wire ethertype is the inner protocol):
 *     IP4 slot   <- untag_ip4_table   (DHCPv4 broadcast match)
 *     IP6 slot   <- untag_ip6mc_table (33:33 DA prefix), else ~0
 *     OTHER slot <- untag_other_table (LLDP match)
 *     No chain between them: DHCPv4 only ever reaches the IP4 slot,
 *     IPv6 only the IP6 slot, LLDP only OTHER.  The ARP and IPv6
 *     punts therefore never interact on an untagged member.
 *
 *   Tagged member (wire ethertype is 0x8100 -> OTHER slot):
 *     IP4 slot   <- ~0
 *     IP6 slot   <- ~0   (tagged IPv6 lands in OTHER, not here)
 *     OTHER slot <- tag_dhcp_table (DHCPv4 over .1Q match)
 *                       |  on miss
 *                       v
 *                   continue normal L2 path
 *     (LLDP is never tagged, so no tagged-LLDP table is needed.)
 *
 *   With flood suppression configured, the punting variants take over.
 *   Untagged, each simply owns its own slot:
 *     ARP   -> OTHER slot <- untag_arp_table -> untag_other_table
 *     IPv6  -> IP6 slot   <- untag_ip6mc_table
 *   Tagged, everything shares the OTHER slot, so the head of the
 *   miss-chain encodes the combination:
 *     both     -> tag_ip6mc_table      -> tag_arp_table -> tag_dhcp_table
 *     IPv6only -> tag_ip6mc_only_table ->                  tag_dhcp_table
 *     ARP only -> tag_arp_table        ->                  tag_dhcp_table
 *     neither  -> tag_dhcp_table
 *
 * Hit-next graph slots out of l2-input-classify, resolved once via
 * vpp_add_node_next():
 *   - linux-cp-punt          : LLDP, untagged DHCPv4, untagged ARP and
 *     untagged IPv6 multicast
 *   - sonic-ext-l2-trap-fixup: tagged DHCPv4, tagged ARP and tagged IPv6
 *     multicast (rewrites VLIB_RX from bridged sub-if to parent phys
 *     before handing to linux-cp-punt, because a bridged sub-if has no
 *     LCP pair).
 *   - sonic-ext-l2-vlan-filter: 802.1Q frames on an untagged (access)
 *     member.  Accepts frames whose VID equals the member's access
 *     VLAN (pops the tag and re-bridges) and drops any other VID, so
 *     the tag-agnostic access bridge port does not flood foreign VLANs.
 * Untagged DHCP does not need the fixup node: VLIB_RX on an untagged
 * bridge member is already the parent phys, so linux-cp-punt resolves
 * the right LCP pair directly.

     * not delivered to the other bridge members, which is what "do not

     * anything useful with the punted copy is a separate question -- the
     * flood suppression is required either way.
     *
     * Match is the 33:33 DA prefix, i.e. all IPv6 multicast (RFC 2464):
     * NS/DAD (33:33:ff:xx:xx:xx), RS (33:33:00:00:00:02), MLD and
     * all-nodes (33:33:00:00:00:01).
     *
     * The ethertype is deliberately NOT part of the match: this table is
     * bound to the IP6 slot, and l2-input-classify only selects that slot
     * for outer ethertype 0x86DD, so it is already implied.
     *
     * Deliberately scoped to IPv6 rather than "all multicast" (mask 0x01
     * on byte 0): there is no CoPP/policer on this path, so a multicast
     * data stream would reach the host tap at line rate.
     *
     * The IP6 slot carries nothing else, so no chaining is needed and the
     * LLDP/DHCP/ARP tables are untouched -- which is precisely why the
     * untagged IPv6 punt is fully independent of the untagged ARP punt.

/*
 * SAI_VLAN_ATTR_BROADCAST_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE /
 * SAI_VLAN_ATTR_UNKNOWN_MULTICAST_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE handler.
 *
 * orchagent sets both to SAI_VLAN_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE_NONE when proxy ARP is
 * enabled on a VLAN interface (IntfsOrch::setIntfProxyArp ->
 * setIntfVlanFloodType) and back to SAI_VLAN_FLOOD_CONTROL_TYPE_ALL when it is
 * disabled, but SAI keeps them independent and they are honoured independently
 * here.
 *
 * Both are implemented purely with the l2-input-classify punt tables; the
 * bridge domain's L2INPUT_FEAT_FLOOD bit is deliberately left alone.
 *
 * Why the classifier and not the flood bit: a classify hit is terminal.
 * l2-input-classify dispatches the frame straight to the session's next node
 * and clears only L2INPUT_FEAT_INPUT_CLASSIFY -- it never calls
 * vnet_l2_feature_next(), so the frame leaves the L2 feature arc and l2-flood
 * is never reached.  Punting a traffic class therefore *is* flood suppression
 * for that class, and it is per class, which is exactly the granularity SAI
 * asks for.  The flood bit cannot do this: VPP has a single
 * L2INPUT_FEAT_FLOOD covering broadcast *and* multicast, so clearing it would
 * apply both attributes at once, and it would additionally make l2-input strip
 * L2INPUT_FEAT_FWD from every frame whose DA has the multicast bit set,
 * dropping them at feature-bitmap-drop instead of punting them.
 *
 *   broadcast NONE         -> punt broadcast ARP (dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
 *   unknown multicast NONE -> punt IPv6 multicast (dst 33:33:*)
 *
 * The punted copy is delivered to the member's LCP host tap.  Whether the
 * control plane acts on it is independent of this: the flood suppression the
 * attribute asks for happens either way.
 *
 * Traffic outside those two matches still floods, so NONE is honoured for the
 * control-plane classes rather than literally.  Widening the matches is
 * deliberately avoided -- there is no CoPP/policer on the punt path, so a
 * broad match would let a data-plane stream reach the host tap at line rate.

/*
 * This function determines the ID of a newly created PortChannel.
 * It does this by querying the list of PortChannels using the ip command and
 * comparing it to the bond ids already claimed by a registered LAG.
 *
 * The kernel netdev name is the only source of the number: SAI passes no name
 * with a LAG object, and a bond record's "PortChannel<N>" is built FROM its id,
 * so the registry can supply the already-used set but never a new id.
 *
 * This function is necessary due to the way IP addresses are set on interfaces in Sonic-VPP,
 * which requires mapping between the PortChannel interface and the BondEthernet in VPP.
 * Although no issues have been observed during manual and sonic-mgmt testing,
 * it should be noted that this design may theoretically present a race condition,
 * where the wrong ID is returned for a given LAG interface if multiple PortChannels are created concurrently.
